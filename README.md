# BridgeBlacklist
This is a PocketMine-MP plugin that utilizes the EPICMC Bridge Blacklist API. Which allows server owners to easily maintain peace across an entire network.

If a player or IP address is blacklisted this plugin will kick them whenever they join.

To download the required API and read documentation [click here](https://github.com/EPICMC/Blacklist-API). A configuration file will be generated the first time you join. Edit the URL to point to the blacklist.php file on your webserver.
