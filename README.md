# BridgeBlacklist
This is a PocketMine-MP plugin that utilizes the EPICMC Bridge Blacklist API. Which allows server owners to easily maintain peace across an entire network.

If a player or IP address is blacklisted this plugin will kick them whenever they join.

To download the required API and read documentation [click here](https://github.com/EPICMC/Blacklist-API). A configuration file will be generated the first time you join. Edit the URL to point to the blacklist.php file on your webserver.

For people who want to run this plugin from source and DevTools says "Incompatible api version", get this:
